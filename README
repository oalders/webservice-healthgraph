DESCRIPTION
    BETA BETA BETA. The interface is subject to change.

    This is a very thin wrapper around the Runkeeper (Health Graph) API. At
    this point it assumes that you already have an OAuth token to connect
    with. You can use Mojolicious::Plugin::Web::Auth::Site::Runkeeper to
    create a token. If that doesn't suit you, patches to add OAuth token
    retrieval to this module will be happily accepted.
