# ABSTRACT: A thin wrapper around the Runkeeper (Health Graph) API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BETA BETA BETA.  The interface is subject to change.

This is a very thin wrapper around the Runkeeper (Health Graph) API.  At this
point it assumes that you already have an OAuth token to connect with.  You can
use L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Web::Auth::Site::Runkeeper> to create a token.  If
that doesn't suit you, patches to add OAuth token retrieval to this module will
be happily accepted.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $runkeeper = WebService::HealthGraph->new(
        debug => 1,
        token => 'foo',
    );

    my $user = $runkeeper->user;

    use Data::Printer;
    p $user->content;

    # Fetch a weight feed

    use DateTime ();
    use URI::FromHash qw( uri );

    my $cutoff = DateTime->now->subtract( days => 7 );

    my $uri = uri(
        path  => '/weight',
        query => { noEarlierThan => $cutoff->ymd },
    );

    my $feed = $runkeeper->get($uri, { feed => 1 });
    p $feed->content;

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS

=head2 auto_pagination

Boolean.  If enabled, response objects will continue to fetch new result pages
as the iterator requires them.  Defaults to true.

=head2 base_url

The URL of the API.  Defaults to L<https://api.runkeeper.com>.  This is
settable in case you'd need this for mocking.

=head2 debug( $bool )

Turns on debugging via L<LWP::ConsoleLogger>.  Off by default.

=head2 token

OAuth token. Optional, but you'll need to to get any URLs.

=head2 ua

A user agent object of the L<LWP::UserAgent> family.  If you provide your own,
be sure you set the correct default headers required for authentication.

=head2 url_map

Returns a map of keys to URLs, as provided by the C<user> endpoint.  Runkeeper
wants you to use these URLs rather than constructing your own.

=head2 uri_for

Gives you the corresponding url (in the form of an L<URI> object) for any key
which exists in C<url_map>.  You can optionally pass a HashRef of query params
to this method.

    my $team_uri =  $runkeeper->uri_for( 'team', { pageSize => 10 } );

    my $friends = $runkeeper->get(
        $runkeeper->uri_for( 'team', { pageSize => 10 } ),
        { feed => 1 }
    );

=head2 user

The L<WebService::HealthGraph::Response> object for the C<user> endpoint.

=head2 user_id

The id of the user as provided by the C<user> endpoint.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get( $url, $optional_args )

This module will try to do the right thing with the minimum amount of
information:

    my $weight_response = $runkeeper->get( 'weight', { feed => 1 } );
    if ( $weight_response->success ) {
        ...
    }

Optionally, you can provide your own Accept (or other) headers:

    my $record_response = $runkeeper->get(
        'records',
        {
            headers =>
                { Accept => 'application/vnd.com.runkeeper.Records+json' }
        );

Returns a L<WebService::HealthGraph::Response> object.

=head1 CAVEATS

Most response content will contain a C<HashRef>, but the C<records> endpoint
returns a response with an C<ArrayRef> in the content.
